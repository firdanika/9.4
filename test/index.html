  <h1>Happy Birthday, My Love!</h1>
  <p>
Today is your birthday, my love. I feel so thankful for having you in my life. You make me feel incredibly lucky just by being yourself. Finding someone as wonderful as you, who understands me so well and brings so much happiness and secure, is truly amazing. Even though we're far apart in this long-distance relationship, I never feel distant from you. Being with you has helped me learn more about myself. I tend to overthink too much, and you have attachment issues. But what's truly special is how you understand me. You know what makes me happy and hate. I really appreciate you always keep me update and clingy tpi jangan terover clingy hahaha. And I love how you reassure me with your words whenever I'm overthinking things. I hope I can give you the same comfort without adding to your worries about attachment. If we ever have disagreements, I hope we can resolve them quickly.  And if I do something that upsets you, please let me know.  I hope our relationship continues to grow stronger until we're old and married. I can't wait to do lots of fun things together.  </p>
  <p>With you, I see a future bright, </p>
  <p>Filled with laughter, love, and light. </p>
  <p>Hand in hand, we'll face life's fray, </p>
  <p>Growing stronger with each passing day. </p>
