  <h1>Happy Birthday, My Love!</h1>
  <p>
    Today marks the celebration of your birthday, my love, and I find myself overwhelmed with gratitude for your presence in my life. Your acceptance of me, just as I am, fills me with an indescribable sense of fortune. To have found someone as beautiful as you, who not only understands me but also brings me immeasurable happiness and security, is a blessing beyond measure. Despite the miles that separate us in this long-distance relationship, I have never felt the chasm of distance between us. Since we've been together, I've discovered more about myself. I tend to overthink stuff, and you're naturally anxious about attachment. But what's amazing is how much you understand me. You know what brings me joy and what bothers me. I really appreciate how you enjoy keeping me in the loop and being affectionate, even if it's a tad overwhelming sometimes (but in an adorable way!). And I love how you reassure me with words every time I have a silly question due to my overthinking. I just hope I can offer you the same comfort without adding to your attachment worries. I hope our relationship grows stronger until we're married and old together. If we ever argue or fight, I hope we can sort it out quickly. Remember, if I do something you don't like, please tell me. I can't wait to do lots of activities together.
